WSGI Utils (Version 0.2)
------------------------
Version 0.2
-----------
New features:
 - Added some unit tests

Bug fixes:
 - Use a time stamp rather than the client IP as the second part of the session
   ID so that it works for WSGI implementations that don't provide the client IP.
 - Session last access time wasn't updated when it needed to be (sessions 
   timed out).
 - Moved session server logging configuration to daemon.

Version 0.1
-----------
Initial release.
