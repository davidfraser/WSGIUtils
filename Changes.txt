WSGI Utils (Version 0.3)
------------------------

Version 0.3
-----------
The API for wsgiAdaptor has been cleaned up and extended in this release - 
please refer to the API documentation for details.

New features:
 - Serving of files can be disabled by passing in serveFiles=0 to the 
   wsgiServer constructor.
 - wsgiAdaptor API cleanup.
 
Bug fixes:
 - Applications registering for a particular URL now receive all requests for 
   that URL's children paths.
 
Version 0.2
-----------
New features:
 - Added some unit tests

Bug fixes:
 - Use a time stamp rather than the client IP as the second part of the session
   ID so that it works for WSGI implementations that don't provide the client 
   IP.
 - Session last access time wasn't updated when it needed to be (sessions 
   timed out).
 - Moved session server logging configuration to daemon.

Version 0.1
-----------
Initial release.
